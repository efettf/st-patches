desktopentry
============

Description
-----------
Creates a desktop-entry for st. This enables to find st in a graphical menu and
to display it with a nice icon.

If some applications still are not displaying an icon for st try the patch
[netwmicon](../netwmicon/). Programs like tint2 and alttab rely on a hardcoded
icon which has to be stored by st in the \_NET\_WM\_ICON window-property.
