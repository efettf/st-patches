Description
-----------
*"Inspired by the beauty of the arctic, the colors reflect the cold, yet
harmonious world of ice and the colorfulness of the Aurora Borealis."*
- [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/)

Selection-Colors
----------------
The default behaviour of st is to reverse the fore- and background colors of
each selected cell. If you don't want the selection-colors to be reveresed but
instead have fixed fore- and background colors apply on top of this patch the
[selectioncolors](../selectioncolors/)-patch. Then set the following settings in
your config.h:

	unsigned int selectionbg = 0;
	unsigned int selectionfg = 256;
