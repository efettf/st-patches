Alternative implementation that uses a ring buffer for more
efficient scrolling:

kscrollup/kscrolldown.

Apply the following patch on top of the previous to allow scrolling
using `Shift+MouseWheel`.

Apply the following patch on top of the previous two to allow scrollback using
mouse wheel only when not in `MODE_ALTSCREEN`. For example the content is being
scrolled instead of the scrollback buffer in `less`. Consequently the Shift
modifier for scrolling is not needed anymore. **Note: patches before
`20191024-a2c479c` might break mkeys other than scrolling functions.**

Apply the following patch on top of the first two to allow changing how fast the mouse scrolls.

Apply the following patch on top of the first two to allow a `\e[ m` escape,
marking the line to quickly scroll to with Control+{PageUp, PageDown}.

Notes
-----
* Patches modify config.def.h, you need to add mkeys to your own config.h
* With patches before `20191024-a2c479c`: you can not have a mshortcut for the
  same mkey so remove Button4 and Button5 from mshortcuts in config.h
* The mouse and altscreen patches `20191024-a2c479c` (and later) are simpler and
  more robust because st gained better support for customized mouse shortcuts.
  As a result, the altscreen patch doesn't really need the mouse patch. However
  to keep it simple the instructions stay the same: the alrscreen patch still
  applies on top of the (now very minimal) mouse patch.
